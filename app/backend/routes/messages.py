"""
Message routes — POST /api/conversations/{conv_id}/messages

Orchestrates the tool-driven RAG flow:
  1. Verify conversation ownership (404 cross-user, no leak)
  2. Enforce 25 msg/user/24h cap
  3. Save user message
  4. Load conversation history
  5. Invoke the LLM with retrieval tools declared; the model drives
     retrieval via tool calls (search_videos, keyword_search_videos,
     semantic_search_videos, get_video_transcript). No pre-retrieval.
  6. Stream the response as SSE
  7. Send the sources event (populated from the model's tool calls) before [DONE]
  8. Persist the assistant message after the stream completes

      all chunks if none were cited), so the deep-link opens near the most
