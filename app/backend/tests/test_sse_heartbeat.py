"""
Tests for the SSE keepalive heartbeat emitted by `stream_chat` during
silent periods (tool-call argument streaming and tool execution).

Without keepalives, Kimi K2.6 reliably goes 60-140 seconds of zero SSE
bytes on tool-heavy queries while the model streams tool_call args and
we await the executor. Browsers and reverse proxies idle-timeout those
sockets after ~60s, killing the connection before the first user-visible
token arrives. These tests lock in the fix from issue #158 follow-up:
comment-line heartbeats (`: keepalive\n\n`) emitted every few seconds
during silent phases.
