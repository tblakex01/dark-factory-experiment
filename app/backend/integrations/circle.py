"""Circle Admin v2 API client for paid-membership verification.

Used by `routes/auth.py` to set the `users.is_member` flag on signup, login,
and `/me` refresh. Per issue #147 spec:

- 5-second timeout (Circle API is fast; long waits would block auth flow).
- **Fail-closed**: any error — timeout, network failure, non-2xx response,
  unexpected JSON shape, missing config — returns False. Users default to
  non-member status; the next /me refresh retries.
- The function never raises; callers can call it unconditionally.
