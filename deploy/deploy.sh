# Reload Caddy reliably. `caddy reload` re-parses the Caddyfile (which imports
# upstream.conf), but in 2026-04 we hit a case where the live in-memory config
# kept dialing the old container even though upstream.conf on disk had been
# rewritten. Production 502'd until Caddy was hard-restarted. The fix: after
# `caddy reload`, check that the running Caddy config actually contains the
# expected upstream; if not, fall back to `docker restart` (~3s downtime,
# vastly better than an indefinite outage).
